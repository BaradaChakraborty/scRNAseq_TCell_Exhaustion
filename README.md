Welcome to my Computational Immunology Sandbox. I built this repository to serve as my experimental workspace and parent framework for developing, testing, and optimizing bioinformatics pipelines. Instead of just running a single static analysis, I designed this space to be modular and highly reusable. It allows me to experiment with new algorithms, trace complex transcriptomic research paths, and deploy code that works seamlessly from processing raw single-cell data all the way to modeling clinical survival. Right now, the main case study driving this sandbox is a deep dive into the spatial, metabolic, and clinical trajectory of CD8+ T-cell exhaustion within the tumor microenvironment.

The framework is broken down into four core modules. The first focuses on high-dimensional manifold learning. Here, I use Seurat to perform rigorous quality control, log-normalization, principal component analysis, and UMAP projections. By applying unsupervised graph-based clustering, specifically the Louvain algorithm, I can digitally isolate specific immune lineages and map out continuous developmental states, like the transition from functional to terminally exhausted T-cells.

The second module dives into spatial and pathway analytics. I engineered workflows to map receptor-ligand interactions, specifically tracking the physical communication breakdown between the tumor stroma and infiltrating lymphocytes by looking at the CX3CR1 and CX3CL1 axis. I also integrated whole-transcriptome Gene Set Enrichment Analysis using clusterProfiler to mathematically quantify the systemic collapse of major biological networks, such as the inflammatory response.

For the third module, I focus on algorithmic biomarker discovery. I experiment with ensemble machine learning by training Random Forest classifiers to take high-dimensional single-cell data spanning over 20,000 genes and distill it down to lean, highly accurate diagnostic panels. I rely on metrics like MeanDecreaseGini to strictly rank feature importance and validate the models with confusion matrices.

The final module bridges basic science and clinical oncology through in silico translation. Using TCGAbiolinks and the survival and survminer packages, I built a pipeline to query The Cancer Genome Atlas. This allows me to test the biomarker panels I discovered using machine learning against real-world human bulk RNA-seq data, simulating clinical hazard ratios and running Log-Rank tests to generate Kaplan-Meier survival curves.

A major goal of this parent script is to automatically output rigorous, publication-quality visualizations, from global UMAP projections to clinically calibrated survival plots. As a living sandbox, I am actively expanding this framework. My upcoming experimental branches will integrate Python-based deep learning, transitioning from standard PCA to Variational Autoencoders using scvi-tools, and upgrading my classifiers to gradient boosting frameworks like XGBoost.
